# Frontend Developer Assignment - CodeAnt

## Overview

This project is a frontend implementation based on a Figma design provided as part of the frontend developer assignment at CodeAnt. The goal of this assignment is to evaluate the ability to implement a design using ReactJS, HTML, and CSS while ensuring the code is clean, maintainable, and scalable.

## Features

- Fully responsive layout across various screen sizes and devices
- Implemented using ReactJS for building dynamic components
- CSS for styling the layout and achieving design consistency
- Performance-optimized components to ensure fast rendering
- Adherence to the Figma design to maintain accuracy
- Clean, maintainable, and well-documented code

## Tech Stack

- ReactJS
- HTML
- CSS
- Git for version control

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)

### Steps to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shiveejaiswal/CodeAnt-AI
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd CodeAnt-AI
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will run the application locally on `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Contains all React components and assets.
- `components/` - Reusable UI components.
- `assets/` - Images, icons, fonts, etc.
- `App.js` - Main entry point of the application.
- `public/` - Contains static files, such as `index.html`.
- `package.json` - Contains project metadata and dependencies.
